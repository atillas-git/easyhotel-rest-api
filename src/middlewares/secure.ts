/**
 * @author Atilla Sina PostacÄ±
 * @param policies Union type that user needs in order to access to specific backend enpoints.
 * Can either be a array of strings or just a string.
 * Default behavior is 'or' that means if user has one of the policies in the defines array, in that case it can access the enpoint.
 * The reason why this is the case is because we might have different policies that access to the same resources in some parts of our app.
 * If you want the behavior change, you can change it by supplying the operator to "and".
 * @returns Passes the logic to the next middleware in the chain or returns an unauthorized response.
